‘Walking Dead’ Fans Split On Recent Harlem Globetrotters Crossover Episode,News in Brief,2018-11-30T13:09:00-06:00,"ATLANTA—Noting that late-season gimmicks have often had dire results for past series, fans of zombie drama The Walking Dead found themselves divided this week concerning a recent crossover episode featuring legendary basketball team the Harlem Globetrotters. “It was a nice touch of whimsy when the Globetrotter’s bus broke down near the containment wall, but honestly, it also kind of seems like they’re running out of ideas,” said longtime viewer Albert Garcia, who said he enjoyed the scene in which Rick Grimes and Curly Neal foraged for supplies in the ruins of an abandoned basketball arena, but also felt the storyline lacked the emotional gravitas that has come to define the show through its first nine seasons. “I’m not really sure how I felt about the part where the Dizzy took off a zombie’s head and spun it on his finger. That said, I did chuckle when Big Easy doused Negan with a bucket of confetti. Overall, though, it seemed a little desperate. And, naturally, it was kind of a bummer when that one racist character came back to kill them all at the end.” Fan reaction to the episode seemed almost unanimous, however, in that the Globetrotters’ appearance on The Walking Dead made far more sense than than the exhibition basketball team’s central, pivotal role in the 2009 series finale of Battlestar Galactica."

If I end up trapped at this goddamn conference the whole time and don’t even get to try some authentic asado while I’m here, I’ll be so pissed.

Mark my words: One day, I’m going to ditch this man for something better and then repeat the cycle.” At press time, Dixon had giddily saved her companion’s mobile number into her phone contacts as “Future Mr. Wrong.”"

I can’t wait to try these easy and effective torture techniques he showed us, and I’ll definitely be applying the prince’s ‘Three Ds’ approach of dismember, destroy evidence, and deny to my next press killing.” Nieto added that by the end of the class, he was a devoted practitioner of the crown prince’s methods and announced he was completely convinced that the Saudis had nothing to do with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi."

The worst is when they barely know my stuff and they bring me a James Patterson novel to write.” King, however, admitted that he did get the idea for The Shining when writing a personalized novel for a fan named Jack Torrance during a 1974 book signing."

Once the tides rise to overtake our cities, it will already be too late: Humanity stands no chance against their powers of echolocation and high-pitched vocalization.” At press time, reports had confirmed numerous sightings of a flag bearing a dorsal fin mounted on one of the Marshall Islands’ eroded beaches."

They may also have spoken of how completely disgusted they would be if someone were to obtain the emails of an opponent’s political campaign and then publish them. But that’s it.

We are not going to let the Senate make an ill-considered decision to destroy the carefully built relationship between the Saudis and the Raytheon people.” At press time, the House Raytheon executives had voted unanimously in favor of a new congressional resolution that would put the entire U.S. defense budget earmarked for the war in Yemen under Raytheon’s direct control."

Historians Reveal Thousands Of Immigrants Were Forced To Change Hairstyle At Ellis Island,News in Brief,2018-11-28T10:18:00-06:00,"NEW YORK—Offering new insights into what life may have been like for people who left their folkways and cultures behind to begin a new life, a group of American historians unearthed documentation that thousands of immigrants were forced to change their hairstyles upon entering the United States at Ellis Island. “Upon discovering detailed records of all those who immigrated through the Ellis Island facility from 1892 to 1954, we can confirm that almost a million of those who sought their fortune in our country began their journey with a government-mandated hairstyle purported to present a more American look,” said historian Elizabeth Stern, noting that it wasn’t uncommon for government officials to choose a prospective citizen’s new look for them from a book of photos featuring roughly 50 approved hairdos. “Most immigrants arrived with traditional ethnic hairstyles, which were difficult for American barbers and hairstylists to work with and marked them as outsiders to potential employers. Going, say, with a dramatically shorter length, was a struggle for many whose hairstyles had been in their family for countless years. Many felt as though they were trimming a part of themselves, but officials felt it was really in their best interest to assimilate with a bob or even a blunt cut. You can see in some of the earlier photos that the younger children in particular often wept as they were subjected to harsh bowl cuts––they really sacrificed so much hair to come here. It’s sad, but millions of people today wouldn’t even recognize their original family hairstyle.” Stern added that the records indicate thousands of immigrants from Slovakia, Austria-Hungary, and Poland were turned away after refusing to get choppy layers."

But obviously, the blame falls squarely on us. We thought we learned a lot from this unfortunate accident, but clearly we didn’t learn enough.” At press time, band leader Dave Matthews had personally offered to provide free lifetime concert tickets to the victims if this somehow happened a third time."

Coalition Of Concerned Parents Condemns Video Games’ False Depiction Of How Easy It Is To Smash Wooden Crates,News in Brief,2018-11-26T11:04:00-06:00,"EUGENE, OR—Citing the potential threat to the safety of their children, a coalition of concerned parents issued a statement Monday condemning dozens of popular video games spanning a range of publishers and platforms for what they claimed were grossly misleading depictions of the difficulty involved in smashing wooden crates. “If game developers don’t stop and consider their influence on children, we’re going to see a generation of kids grow to adulthood with a completely distorted notion of physics—millions of kids conditioned to believe that punching or kicking a crate will cause it to burst into splinters or, in some cases, even trigger some kind of explosion,” said the group’s spokesperson Laura Egan, blaming video games for an increasing number of broken knuckles, sprained knees, and contused foreheads each year and speculating that number will surge as more gamers enter an increasingly box-centric American workforce. “Most real-world wooden crates are sturdy enough to withstand the rigors of transcontinental shipping, and it takes a considerable amount of force and time to actually break one open. Will our children be prepared to deal with the bruises and splinters that may arise while smashing crates, especially in a future where they will be seeking weapons and healthcare items more frantically than any American generation since the 1940s? Which leads us to ask, will they expect coins to liberally float in the air after the work is done? We’re still waiting for the multi-billion-dollar video game industry to answer us.” The concerned parents did, however, commend the gaming industry for warning children that shooting red barrels or drums would result in a devastating explosion capable of killing bosses."
"Putin Condemns Ukrainian People’s Unprovoked 1,000-Year Occupation Of South Russia",News in Brief,2018-11-26T17:18:00-06:00,"MOSCOW—Condemning the actions of the Ukranians over the past millennium as “completely unacceptable by the standards of free and civilized people,” Russian president Vladimir Putin condemned on Monday the unprovoked 1,000-year Ukrainian occupation of South Russia. “We will no longer stand for this inexcusable and unjustifiable display of naked hostility by the Ukrainians, who have baselessly claimed legitimate residence in the region since settling the area in the 10th century,” said Putin, adding that the Ukrainian people’s hawkish and belligerent decision to continue living in villages and cultivating the land would not go unpunished. “Russia cannot be expected to sit back and do nothing while our Black Sea ports are overrun by Ukrainians, as they have been for the better part of recorded history. Does history not demonstrate that millions of South Russian civilians have perished in the occupied region since Oleg of Novgorod first captured Kiev in 882? The Ukrainians must pay dearly for their deceitful and prolonged attack.” Putin went on to demand that all Poles, Finns, and Lithuanians immediately withdraw from their regions of occupied Russia as well. "

Then, I look over at my wife, and suddenly she’s glowing blue and she’s screaming at me to get that thing out of her! I mean, don’t get me wrong—it’s kind of nice that it can turn on my TV and stuff, but no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to break the skin.” At press time, the U.S. populace had reportedly taken to the streets after discovering that they had each been charged $69 for the device."

Now that we have a method to discern between drop-dead-gorgeous slime molds versus nasty-ass slime molds, we can make major steps toward better comprehending our world. Obviously, all the single-celled organisms are hideous while the more complex life forms will, at the very least, be considered fuckable.” At press time, biologists announced that humans had been removed from the Hominidae family and placed into the butt-ugly category along with opossums and all species of birds."

Tear Gas Manufacturers Worried About Association With Everything Tear Gas Used For,News in Brief,2018-11-26T16:00:00-06:00,"JAMESTOWN, PA—Upon learning that their products had been utilized by U.S. border patrol agents on migrants attempting to enter the country, tear gas manufacturers were reportedly worried Monday about their association with everything that tear gas is used for. “It’s troubling to turn on the news and see that our products were involved in such a heinous, violent situation where they were clearly used exactly as intended,” said Combined Systems CEO Donald Smith, echoing the concerns of other major tear gas manufacturers about seeing their products being linked to spraying protesters, refugees, and other unarmed people with tear gas. “When the media shows people with chemical burns in their eyes or choking on tear gas to the point of vomiting, it doesn’t make the average person view tear gas in a favorable light. Tear gas has always been intended for soldiers, law enforcement, and other authorities to control other, less powerful people by causing them severe pain, so any association with it being used according to its designed purpose really doesn’t look good for us. We just want to stress that our intended use for tear gas, whether it’s to disperse peaceful activists or to assault crowds of migrants, could not be any closer to what these products were actually used for.” The nation’s tear gas manufacturers added that critics of their products consistently failed to appreciate the care that they took to ensure that tear gas was not supposed to be lethal."
Study Finds Dogs Twitching In Sleep Are Dreaming About Tearing Owners Limb From Limb,News in Brief,2018-11-26T10:29:00-06:00,"ITHACA, NY—A study released Monday by animal behaviorists at Cornell University found that dogs that twitch, move their paws repeatedly, or growl in their sleep are, in fact, dreaming vividly about tearing their owners limb from limb. “After thousands of hours of observation, we are forced to conclude that any dog witnessed making even the slightest of movements in its sleep is living out a cathartic vision of absolutely mauling their owners,” said lead researcher Dr. Hana Michaels, adding that any dog, regardless of breed, size, gender, or degree of training, was visualizing the act of devouring its master if observed fidgeting even the slightest bit while sleeping. “Many dogs will suddenly jerk their bodies as if they’ve been startled in their sleep; in fact, they’re seeing themselves pawing your face off, sinking their teeth into your neck, and feeling the hot gush of your life’s blood against the backs of their throats. It seems the faster they churn their little legs while curled up on their beds or favorite spots on the couch, the more intent they are about chewing off all your extremities and rooting around in your chest cavity. The quiet whimpers that you think are so sweet are actually coded pack signals calling all other canines in the neighborhood to come and satiate themselves upon your organs.” At press time, Michaels added that owners should be concerned if they see their dog licking themselves, as it may be an indicator that their pet has already slaughtered several victims and is meticulously cleaning blood from its fur."

No one could figure out how the Nazis randomly decided to go after Jews and the disabled and Roma and gay people, but by nightfall people were being grabbed off the street and sent to concentration camps, which had all been built over the previous 24 hours. It was crazy—no one had any clue anything bad was going to happen.” The nation’s Holocaust survivors also reportedly recalled that the suddenness of the Holocaust starting was probably why it took so long for anyone to come help them."

A lot of them have lived long, tough lives and are just looking for a good home,” said spokesperson Emily Sullivan, explaining that, while perhaps more aesthetically pleasing, many of the turkeys found in supermarkets are likely to have been cruelly bred in a factory farm or turkey mill with little regard for their wellbeing. “There are so many turkeys in our facilities who need a family, so why not adopt instead of paying top dollar for a ‘designer turkey’ you get through some shady online dealer. Hopefully this Thanksgiving, you can find room for one of these wonderful shelter birds in your nice, warm oven.” Sullivan added that they also offer the option of fostering a turkey until it finds a loving, hungry home. "

In fact, we found that the more a man tries to suppress these thoughts, the more he thinks about big sacks full of presents or what it would be like if he were on the naughty list.” Voltan added that nearly 100 percent of the men in the study reported waking up to thoughts of sitting on Santa’s lap."

Only The Onion news organization offers the sort of high-quality apparel that allows the American people to simultaneously express their disgust with or devotion to our shamefully racist or proudly nationalist president. When a citizen takes a sip from an Onion coffee mug or water bottle, they send a strong message that they support the Resistance or want to Make America Great Again. Put simply, this may be the single most important thing anyone can do as an American.” Gilroy added that all Americans should spend at least $150 at The Onion’s online store to ensure they are standing on the right side of history."

MTA Reveals They Have No Idea Where Voices Speaking To Everyone On Subway Coming From,News in Brief,2018-11-19T12:05:00-06:00,"NEW YORK—Clarifying that none of their trains feature intercom systems, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority revealed Monday they have no clue where the disembodied voice speaking to everyone on the subway was originating. “The MTA has never at any point hired a speaker to tell passengers ‘Stand clear of the closing doors’ or ‘We are delayed because of train traffic ahead,’ so we urge anyone who hears one of these disturbing notices to contact us immediately,” said acting chairman Fernando Ferrer, adding that the individual reportedly likes to repeat these phrases tens of thousands of times a day and is, thus, clearly unstable and probably dangerous. “Our aim has, of course, always been to give riders a silent experience, so the fact that a mysterious woman is apparently shouting the names of each station, telling people to beware the platform edge, and listing all available transfers is deeply, deeply troubling to us. There’s not a single transit car the violators have missed, so we’re encouraging all New Yorkers to be especially vigilant until we apprehend these obviously unhinged people.” Ferrer added that commuters should disregard any and all posted advertisements, which have never been allowed in New York City subway cars."

Open-Ended New Bill Criminalizes Whatever Black People Up To Right Now,News in Brief,2018-11-20T13:15:00-06:00,"WASHINGTON—Saying the measure would provide a substantial boon to police departments nationwide, members of the House Republican caucus introduced a bill Tuesday containing open-ended language that would criminalize whatever it is black people are up to right now. “This is a long-overdue piece of legislation that will help defend our country against the scourge of black people being in places and doing things,” said Rep. Steve King (R-IA) of H.R. 8164, which would penalize black Americans with a minimum of five years in prison and fines of up to $750,000 for any activity they happen to be engaged in whenever law enforcement arrives. “This measure seeks to bring an end to overly permissive laws that, by allowing black people to simply hang around and do different stuff at will, places an undue burden on the police officers who want to arrest them and throw them in jail. While I believe this bill represents a good first step, we of course also need to enact legislation that outlaws anything Hispanics and Muslims might be doing at the moment.” At press time, sources confirmed House GOP leaders had called Capitol Police to report several African American representatives engaged in the suspicious activity of voting against the bill."

Health Experts Say Tackle Football Poses Little Risk For Children Whose Brains Already Don’t Work That Well,Sports News In Brief,2018-11-19T15:26:00-06:00,"CHICAGO—In an announcement perceived as a major reassurance to parents of children with low cognitive abilities, subpar reasoning skills, or who are simply “not all there,” top national pediatric health experts released a report Monday which claims that full-contact football poses little risk to children whose brains already don’t work too well. “Tackle football has long been known to be a high-risk sport, particularly for children under 12, but face it—some of these poor little guys are real knuckle-draggers, so why take away their fun? I mean, what do they have to lose?” said University of Chicago childhood development expert Dr. Maureen Clifford, whose neuropathological research led her to the conclusion that the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy caused by repeated or severe head impacts in children is mitigated by more than 90 percent in cases where the youth presented signs of being a huge dumbass and clearly had a couple screws loose already. “Of course, CTE is the most significant danger when it comes to contact sports like football, and the ages 10 to 18 are especially crucial to healthy neurological growth. But what are the symptoms of CTE? Mood swings, difficult thinking, memory loss? If that sounds like your kid, it’s because your precious little dude is already kind of a bonehead. Blocking, tackling, and getting hit on crossing routes are the least of the reasons why they’re acting like such a goddamn idiot all the time.” The study concluded that, for many of these halfwits, football is in fact their only shot at success."

We regret our actions, and we regret further compromising this discovery by destroying the Neanderthal’s tools, personal possessions, and, indeed, all trace of his culture in a frenzy of homicidal rage. Our behavior was completely unprofessional and unacceptable. We apologize to the Smithsonian, to our backers, and to the scientific community at large. You deserve better.” At press time, the numerous photos taken of the Neanderthal had been lost after those assembled began emitting guttural war whoops and swarming around the camera to smash it with rocks."

Report: Underfunded Public Schools Lacking Basic Support Systems Leave Students Perfectly Prepared For Rest Of Life,News in Brief,2018-11-15T12:55:00-06:00,"WASHINGTON—A report released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Education revealed that underfunded American public schools, most of which lack even the most basic support systems, were producing students who were perfectly prepared for the remainder of their dismal public and professional lives. “We found daily interaction with—if not actual instruction from—a teacher who is inattentive to their needs tends to build a strong familiarity with indifference and neglect, which in turn allows students to transition easily into modern society,” said lead researcher Angela Cunningham, whose team found that grade schoolers experiencing routine systemic disappointment during early education were more than three times as likely to accept drifting through a series of disappointing careers and relationships in adulthood as normal. “Our students will no doubt be ready for the bureaucracy, red tape, and deep sense of resentment that will define the next generation of American jobs. But we cannot rest on our laurels; public schools are the first experience most children have with American society, and it’s crucial that we continue to instill a sense of normalized incompetence and apathy in our young people. It’s our duty as American citizens prepare them for lives of boundless mediocrity.” However, at press time, Cunningham admitted that a false sense of meaningfulness and individual worth from sources such as music, literature, the arts, and even mental health counseling were still major concerns in some of the nation’s wealthiest public school districts."

When I show up at the bar, nobody seems to want to talk to me. It used to come so naturally, but now, when I ask someone about their major, they become uncomfortable and sort of melt away the first chance they get.

According to the statement, the first lady “no longer deserves the honor” of serving in the position, which she has occupied since early 2017. The controversial memo went on to question the personal loyalty of the first lady to the president, going so far as to suggest she was someone widely viewed as “untrustworthy” within the administration. Noting that Melania Trump had repeatedly complained about the first lady to White House chief of staff John Kelly, sources painted a portrait of an East Wing in disarray and in desperate need of a shake-up. The unprecedented call for the ouster of a first lady by Ms. Trump has fueled speculation that she enjoys a great deal of influence over her husband. At press time, anonymous White House sources confirmed that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had been meeting with possible first lady replacements for several months."
NRA Publishes Tips For Staying Safe While Committing A Mass Shooting,News in Brief,2018-11-13T14:55:00-06:00,"FAIRFAX, VA—Citing its longtime commitment to the promotion of safety among firearm enthusiasts, the National Rifle Association published a series of pointers Tuesday on how to keep safe while carrying out a mass shooting. “Every gun owner should know the NRA’s fundamental safety rules so they can avoid being tackled or disarmed in the middle of their deadly spree,” said spokesperson Dana Loesch, explaining that guns should always be loaded, held with a finger on the trigger, and pointed in the direction of anyone trying to stop a shooter from unleashing carnage at a shopping mall, house of worship, of former place of employment. “Before you go spraying bullets from an AR-15 into the crowd at a concert, make sure you familiarize yourself with the venue’s entrances and exits, chaining them shut if possible. Also identify restrooms or stairwells where you can barricade yourself and reload before reemerging to make your final stand against law enforcement.” Loesch added a reminder to stretch before mass shootings to avoid pulling a hamstring or twisting an ankle while exercising one’s Second Amendment rights."

They endured chokeslams, flying elbows, and piledrivers, and many of them courageously laid the smackdown to protect the freedoms of this great nation.

Even if it means pounding the pavement in my Lexus hybrid, only dining out five or six times a week, and forking out that much more for rent each month, I’ll just buckle down, grit my teeth, and ask my parents for the extra cash,” said Rothwell, 24, stressing that she’s not afraid of failure or having to start back at square one, as she would suffer no financial or material repercussions whatsoever in doing so. “Look, I know that there are huge risks involved in dropping everything to chase your dreams, but I’m more willing to go out on that ledge than most people, because I have faith in my dream and in the financial advisors who are ready to cushion my fall.” At press time, the rejection of her script by two studios had forced Rockwell to consider a return home in disgrace to New York, where she would put aside her dreams and help run her family’s multi-million-dollar investment firm."
Family Figures Grandpa Never Talks About WWII Because Nothing Interesting Happened To Him,News in Brief,2018-11-12T14:07:00-06:00,"ATHENS, OH—Responding to their grandfather’s longtime silence on the subject, the family of World War II veteran Thomas Withers told reporters Monday that they figured the reason he never talked about serving was probably because nothing interesting happened to him. “Grandpa never discusses being stationed in Normandy, and he always gets really quiet whenever the subject comes up, so he must have spent the whole time puttering around Europe and just kind of hanging out,” said granddaughter Elise Phippen, who attributed the sad, distant look that appeared in her maternal grandfather’s eye on the anniversary of D-Day to regrets that he didn’t have even a single cool story to share about being a G.I. “I looked up his platoon, and I know they saw a fair amount of action, but I guess Grandpa was just doing clerical work the whole time or maybe he was working as a cook or something, because he’s never so much as mentioned any of it.” Phippen went on to theorize that Withers’ habit of bolting awake in the middle of the night was likely a side effect of the sheer boredom he experienced doing nothing but sitting in a room playing cards for four years."

Indeed, there are only a select few who can handle the pressure of devoting one’s entire life, and the entirety of time’s existence, to being an all-powerful deity,” said lead researcher Gary Anderson, who noted several factors that contribute to students quitting the journey to Godhood, including cost-prohibitive internships, an inequitable gender breakdown, and the comparatively difficult job market for Supreme Beings. “In many cases, schools would try to entice students by claiming they’d be an all-knowing deity right after college, but graduates soon discover much harsher realities. Even those who do go on to be the ruler and commander of the heavens and earth typically spend a few millenium toiling in underpaid apprenticeship roles.” In a related report, researchers found only 20 percent of philosophy PhD candidates go onto to become Socrates."

So remember, if you have a tampon, please dispose of it properly and safely by finding a trash can, rather than creating an environmental disaster.” Ling also confirmed the gargantuan tampon is responsible for the deaths of 15 cats and dogs that were reported missing last week."

This is a huge breakthrough in the field of nutrition, and we highly recommend people adopt the lifestyle before they fall victim to it.” Haugen went on to speculate that, if a person was fully committed to the Mediterranean diet, it may be possible for them to draw enough life force from the Earth’s population to achieve immortality."

Mueller Wondering Why There All This Drama Over Trump’s Unpaid Parking Violations,News in Brief,2018-11-08T12:24:00-06:00,"WASHINGTON—Expressing confusion as to why everyone was getting so worked up, special counsel Robert Mueller was reportedly wondering Thursday why there was all this drama over Donald Trump’s unpaid parking violations. “I mean, sure, he got some parking tickets, and he really should pay the fines, but it feels like people are freaking out for no reason,” said Mueller, acknowledging that while his investigation into the president had turned up multiple parking violations, including several times when the president had overstayed a parking meter and even a decades-old instance when he left his car in a handicapped zone, it was nothing to foment national mass protests against. “Obviously, it’s not ideal for a sitting president to have outstanding parking fines, but a lot of these are just BS street cleaning things, and honestly, he’s probably not even guilty of some of them. I don’t understand why he’s so resistant to talking to me about, what, maybe a few hundred bucks at most? Now his kids are being brought into it, and I even had to talk to his campaign manager just to make sure it was his vehicle. This whole thing is making a mountain out of a molehill.” Mueller added that he would be happy to cut the amount President Trump owes in half just to get the whole thing over with."

Banning Acosta from the press room is the only reasonable response for these clear lapses in judgment.” At press time, CNN had responded by holding a panel discussion featuring experts arguing over whether Sanders’ denial represented an effective strategy for the Trump administration."

After all, I only get to be governor of one state. I bought a bunch of Faberge eggs and a ton of the rarest luxury cars I could find, but that’s not really doing it for me. I was talking to someone the other day who said I could buy an Egyptian mummy, so maybe I’ll do that. Or I could buy up a bunch of vineyards, or a couple castles? Maybe I can use my time as governor to really get down to work on my dream of finally buying all of Da Vinci’s works.

It’s an uphill battle, of course, but who knows if those polls really capture the enthusiasm of voters out there, like the campaign sign of mine that one of my volunteers saw on someone’s lawn a few weeks ago.

These guys are really exploring their surroundings by selecting to jump off the roof or be buried alive in the prison yard, or they’re discovering whole new sides of themselves by tinkering with tools in the shop to build guillotines, Judas Cradles, and other lethal devices that will ultimately be used to set them free forever. It’s truly inspiring.” At press time, Hubbard added that allowing prisoners to curate their own deaths has also had a profound effect on recidivism."

It’s only reasonable, or else we wouldn’t have paid to continuously bomb your country for nine years straight in the first place. Frankly, the fact that 34,000 of your men, women, and children have set off American cluster munitions since the war ended without the U.S. government receiving so much as a penny of recompense is unacceptable.” The invoice reportedly ended by insisting that, if Laos fails to act soon, the United States will also be forced to charge the country for the millions of tons of munitions that effectively exploded during the war."

For many women, it’s important for them to know that all of humanity is relying on them to keep the species alive before making the commitment to become a mother.” The report also explained that many women are waiting to get married until they can leverage the union into an alliance with the powerful warlord of a post-apocalyptic nomadic tribe."

Trump Claims He Can Overrule Constitution With Executive Order Because Of Little-Known ‘No One Will Stop Me’ Loophole,News in Brief,2018-10-30T13:57:00-05:00,"WASHINGTON—Saying his latest executive order was legal due to an “underutilized but totally feasible workaround,” President Trump claimed Tuesday that he could overrule the U.S. Constitution by means of the relatively obscure “no one will stop me” loophole. “My critics say a constitutional amendment or at least an act of Congress is necessary to end birthright citizenship, but what they don’t realize is that a seldom-evoked administrative guideline ensures I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, because zero people will stand in my way,” said Trump, adding that the largely unheard-of clause allows him to circumvent normal legal proceedings because it’s not like anyone in any branch of government remains effective enough to prevent him from doing so. “Though few modern presidents have made use of it, this loophole has always given the nation’s chief executive unilateral power over the Constitution. Its provisions dictate that the president can sidestep any checks and balances on his power once he has abused his authority so many times that no one can keep track anymore.” Trump added that while his opponents may try to challenge his executive order in court, the loophole also states that by then he will have achieved his immediate political aims."

I mean, half the kids in this class have had at least one parent who will end up in Hell.

Buzz Aldrin Recalls How Easy It Was Getting To The Moon,News in Brief,2018-10-26T10:44:00-05:00,"SATELLITE BEACH, FL—Referring to the Apollo 11 spaceflight and lunar landing as a “walk in the park,” astronaut Buzz Aldrin recalled Friday the relative ease with which he and fellow astronauts Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins reached the moon during heir 1969 mission. “We wore special suits and so on, as I’m sure you know, but in essence we kind of just boarded the rocket and pressed the requisite buttons, and it was pretty much smooth sailing from there. I guess I got a little nauseous during takeoff, but it wasn’t too bad. After a few days sitting in the rocket, we were there,” said Aldrin, admitting that he napped through most of the trip and that Armstrong had to wake him up in time to pilot the lunar module down to the Sea of Tranquility. “The scientists did most of the hard work, if I’m honest, and I floated around and ate snacks to pass the time. If you’ve ever taken a flight from New York to L.A., it’s about the same thing.” Aldrin conceded that it was “kind of tough” to take communion in low-gravity conditions."

Plus, we were so preoccupied with how to ensure that his death was painful that we weren’t spending any time plotting how to cause the most horrendous massacres possible, allowing scores of Yemenis attending weddings or traveling on school field trips to survive. Our focus on killing Mr. Khashoggi has granted hundreds of Yemenis the gift of life.” The crown prince added that the Saudis were prepared to save the lives of even more Yemenis if they could reallocate their resources to inflict mass starvation and a cholera epidemic on a few dissident journalists instead."

Study Finds Effectiveness Of Medical Treatment Skyrockets When Doctor Acts Like Condescending Dick,News in Brief,2018-10-25T11:53:00-05:00,"BALTIMORE—A study published Thursday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the effectiveness of medical treatment skyrockets when the doctor acts like a condescending dick. “Our research proves that a patient’s long-term prognosis is directly and positively tied to having an MD who is an unrepentant, patronizing asshole,” said lead researcher Dr. Bethany Frey, adding that sick patients whose physician waves away their concerns with a brusk, “You’re not the medical professional, I am,” saw a 30 percent increase in survival rates and fewer instances of self-reported pain. “Whether you’re dealing with the common cold or Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, you want a doctor who will rush through your appointment, cut you off before you finish describing your symptoms, and then scribble something on your chart as they walk out of the room. Physicians who showed an empathetic bedside manner had poorer outcomes overall compared to those who are complete pricks. In some cases, being a fucking huge cock is literally the difference between life and death.” The study also confirmed that patients are less likely to abuse pain medications when an eye-rolling nurse curtly tells them to suck it up because it doesn’t hurt that bad."

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Remember this: Our goal is to effectively eliminate all awareness of the fact that we even exist, and you can quote me on that.” The marketing firm, which is said to be a top-five East Coast agency but is taking great pains not to be identified, has already redesigned Uber’s logo to feature a completely blank space."

Nation’s Fact-Checkers Confirm They’ll Probably Wrap Up Evaluating Trump’s Statements By 2050 At Latest,News in Brief,2018-10-23T11:53:00-05:00,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that they needed time to properly inform the public about instances in which the commander in chief had knowingly made false claims, the nation’s fact-checkers confirmed Tuesday that they’ll probably wrap up evaluating President Trump’s statements by 2050 at the latest. “As we’ve seen numerous times, the president has a tendency to stretch the veracity of objective fact, but we’re confident that we’ll have finished fully assessing the truthfulness of his claims within the next several decades,” said PolitiFact researcher Gregory Wu, stressing that the country’s fact-checkers wanted to take their time and thoroughly vet all declarations made by the president in order to ensure that they could compile a complete list of corrections within the next half century. “We’re working around the clock, which is why we’re currently on pace to finish fact-checking everything President Trump said during his first 100 days in office by the late 2020s. It’s crucial for us to carefully examine every word and phrase in order to determine whether the president is deliberately lying and using false information, or whether he simply misspoke or was taken out of context. By 2050, we expect to have fact-checked every one of President Trump’s public statements, interviews, state speeches, and extemporaneous remarks so that American voters can make an informed decision about the president’s relationship with the truth.” At press time, a new speech at a campaign rally by Trump had forced the fact-checkers to push back their deadline to 2075."

Which is great, because KIND was really struggling as a maker of particleboard furniture until someone figured out you could eat these things.” Lubetzky also revealed that six new strains of KIND bar have begun to materialize just in time for the holidays."

The worst damage, however, came from a henchman’s parachute getting sucked into the engine. In 100 percent of those cases, the aircraft exploded.” FAA officials also claimed that the majority of helicopter crashes occurred after a henchman was lifted up by an enemy combatant and decapitated by the spinning blade."

Thom Yorke Admits Vast Majority Of Musical Output Fueled By Constant Fear Of Being One-Upped By Coldplay,News in Brief,2018-10-18T16:34:00-05:00,"OXFORD, ENGLAND—In an uncharacteristically frank and revelatory discussion of his inspirations and creative process, Radiohead frontman and solo artist Thom Yorke admitted Thursday that the vast majority of music he makes is fueled solely by the constant fear of being one-upped by British rock band Coldplay. “When I first heard ‘Yellow’ almost 20 years ago, I knew we were in trouble. I saw no way we could ever compete with them—Radiohead almost broke up completely,” said Yorke, revealing that the opening notes of Coldplay’s simple piano ballad ‘The Scientist’ frustrated him to tears when he realized that he would likely never create anything as sonically perfect. “Yes, we received some minor praise for Kid A and Amnesiac. But critics failed to realize that those albums were just vain attempts to compete with the gorgeously understated melodies and feather-light falsetto that made A Rush Of Blood To The Head so hauntingly beautiful. After that album came out, Jonny, our guitarist, called me in a panic and said we needed to get back in the studio immediately. Coldplay may not have put anything out recently, but I know that they’re just waiting, conserving their strength, preparing to release an incredible concept album and forever unseat us as the second coming of Pink Floyd. It might be enough if, just once, [undisputed genius singer-songwriter and spiritual heir to the musical and thematic legacies of Depeche Mode and Talking Heads] Chris [Martin] would say ‘good job, mate’ after I put out an album, but until then, I’ll try and take motivation from living in his incredibly long shadow.” Yorke added that, had it not been for Coldplay’s epic, genre-defining Super Bowl halftime show, he may never have considered bringing Radiohead’s music to large stadiums."

Study Finds Over 5 Million Birds Die Annually From Head-On Collisions With Clouds,News in Brief,2018-10-19T14:29:00-05:00,"STORRS, CT—Shedding considerable light on a previously mystifying aspect of accidental avian death, a new study from the University of Connecticut has found that direct frontal impacts with clouds kill over 5 million birds every year. “Our observations, some of them quite harrowing, demonstrate that controlled, full-speed flight into a cloud is one of the leading causes of death among birds across nearly all species and spanning every continent on Earth,” said head researcher Rebecca Levin, explaining that bird eyesight has not evolved to perceive large masses of water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere, leading birds to mistakenly believe their course is completely clear when in fact, dangerous, rock-hard clouds are directly in their flight path. “Conversely, many birds with extraordinary vision, such as eagles and hawks, seem to think they can fly right through clouds, shattering their spines almost immediately. The problem is probably made worse by the fact that many clouds seem so soft and fluffy.” Levin and her team hope that their study of bird deaths will help scientists understand why half of airline flights crash every year."

We wish to say we’re deeply sorry, especially to the 59.1 percent of children in the U.S. who received what they had every right to expect were influenza vaccines this fall. Not that it’s anywhere near adequate consolation, but we’re offering a full refund as a partial apology for infecting you with HIV,” said CDC director Robert Redfield, who explained that the two kinds of vials are stocked “really close to each other, and look practically identical.” “We promise to be way more careful in the future. On the plus side, your HIV is only in the acute infection stage, so many of you have a decent amount of time before you develop full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Yes, obviously, the ideal scenario is to have no life-threatening spectrum of infections destroying your white blood cells, especially—and this is extra embarrassing—during flu season, like it is right now. Man, we were so adamant about you getting these shots in the first place, too.” Redfield encouraged Americans to schedule another flu shot just as soon as the CDC followed up on reports that in the rush to correct the error, some replacement batches had been mistakenly swapped out for anthrax."

Sure, it may not seem glamorous, but burning shoe leather never is—and no one wants to be stuck picking pockets or shaving dice when they’re 90,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, whose company strongly encourages millennials to diversify their scams to include modern ventures such as duping counterfeit cryptocurrency and running Russian I.D. farms in addition to wise-old-owl methods like three-card monte. “The good news is that it’s still easy to fall for get-rich-quick schemes, but it’s not anywhere near foolproof. To retire at a decent age, a young conman or conwoman has to have the resilience to ride out the months-long peaks and valleys of the Spanish Prisoner. If you don’t transition into a steady career at the top of a good, steady, money-washing, multilevel lipstick marketing business by the time you reach middle age, then you leave yourself open to a bunch of young buck mechanics with a loaded deck sweeping into town and sniping you at blackjack.” The nation’s top financial analysts also recommended that world-weary femmes fatales and caper men begin planning for one last big heist."

Unfortunately, there was very little we could do before the fumes surrounding Mrs. Trump ignited and she burst into flames. Several staffers were severely impaired in the blast, and we had to make an emergency landing.” At press time, witnesses confirmed a crew of firefighters at the landing site was attempting to put out the still-burning first lady."

Texas Rangers Asking Taxpayers To Cover 60% Of Bribes Related To New Stadium,Sports News In Brief,2018-10-17T10:56:00-05:00,"ARLINGTON, TX—Admitting that the billions of dollars needed to grease the wheels required a joint effort, the Texas Rangers requested Wednesday that taxpayers cover roughly 60 percent of bribes related to the construction of their new stadium. “Between contractors, vendors, and local law enforcement, there’s a lot of under-the-table costs here that we can’t take care of by ourselves,” said Rangers chairman Ray C. Davis, explaining that the team would need to spend millions upfront just to placate the Arlington city council before they could even think about lining the pockets of state legislators and construction crews. “We want to keep the team in Texas, but if the public can’t spare taxpayer money to cover the very real kickback costs, we might be forced to move to a more accommodating city. However, if voters do support the funding, we predict the new stadium will inject millions of dollars back in the local graft economy.” Davis also emphasized that the project would create hundreds of high-paying no-show construction jobs for the siblings of county officials."

The manpower something like this takes is ridiculous. Electronic voting machines should be getting hacked remotely to eliminate even the slightest possibility of a paper trail. Don’t even get me started with Georgia, where they’re still relying on draconian registration laws and inaccessible polling places to suppress the black vote the same way their parents and grandparents did.” At press time, Larson cautioned that many of these antiquated methods were rife for human error and could result in thousands of minorities being allowed to vote."

Sully Sullenberger Realizes It Too Late Now To Let Everyone Know Plane Did All That Stuff On Autopilot,News in Brief,2018-10-12T15:09:00-05:00,"SAN FRANCISCO—Admitting it would be rather awkward to come clean at this juncture now, retired American Airlines pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger realized Friday that it was almost certainly too late to let everybody know that the Airbus A320 of flight 1549, which landed in the Hudson on Jan. 15, 2009 with no loss of life to any of the 155 souls aboard, did so while on autopilot. “I pretty much just made some settings and pressed a button,” said Sullenberger, confessing he likely should have divulged the inconsequential nature of his role in the “miracle on the Hudson” before Time magazine named him one of the “Top 100 Most Influential Heroes And Icons Of 2009.” “Everybody was so happy, and I guess I just sort of got caught up in the moment, because it seemed like it would be just awful to spoil the mood. I mean, I really did press the button, but beyond that I was just along for the ride like everyone else. Don’t get me wrong, it was a scary experience. The autopilot isn’t always perfect, though as you can see, it’s pretty damn close.” Sullenberger said that he had planned to come clean when the producers of Sully approached him about a film deal, but decided to maintain his silence upon learning he would be played by Tom Hanks. "
U.S. Public Health Service Estimates They’ll Have Tuskegee Experiment Wrapped Up By 2020,News in Brief,2018-10-10T12:55:00-05:00,"WASHINGTON—Assuring critics that the study would provide valuable information on the spread of sexually transmitted infections in rural populations, the U.S. Public Health Service announced Wednesday that they estimate to have the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male wrapped up by the year 2020. “After decades of very important research, we’re very close to a meaningful conclusion,” said USPHS representative Meredith Powell, expressing the agency’s immense gratitude for the patience of the American public, especially the hundreds of black people diagnosed with syphilis but not informed of or treated for the disease at the experiment’s start in 1932, and the hundreds more who have been diagnosed with the disease within the past year. “Thanks to the uninformed sacrifice of our subjects, we’re closer than ever before to a true understanding of how syphilis progresses through certain communities, and we are optimistic for a conclusion within the next couple years. We believe penicillin might work as a potential cure, but we’re not yet willing to rule out other remedies, such as homeopathic treatment, or even, say, just letting nature take its course. This is a longitudinal study, and we’re coming very close to narrowing our search down to six or seven potential avenues of treatment, at which point we can finally begin the study’s final stage.” Powell added that once the experiment was completed, the agency would be embarking on a 50-year follow-up study to attempt to reproduce their findings."
ExxonMobil CEO Depressed After Realizing Earth Could End Before They Finish Extracting All The Oil,News in Brief,2018-10-10T11:30:00-05:00,"IRVING, TX—In the wake of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that projected the planet had only a decade to prevent catastrophic global warming, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods was reportedly feeling depressed Wednesday after realizing the Earth could end before they finished extracting all the oil. “When I read about the report, it just hit me like a ton of bricks—we could all die and leave billions of barrels of petroleum trapped in the ground forever,” said Woods, wiping away a tear as he added that the entire oil industry was heartbroken by the thought that they might not have the decades they needed to extract all the oil from the planet as they had originally thought. “We’ve already laid out plans for gas production by future generations of ExxonMobil employees, so it’s just very traumatic for me to consider the idea that they might never get the chance to enjoy the same profits we do now. Just think, one day soon, we’ll all be gone and that oil will still be there in the Earth, never to be removed. It’s a travesty.” At press time, Woods announced ExxonMobil’s plans to quadruple its oil production in an effort to extract it all from the Earth while there was still time."

NFL Urges Pass Rushers To Try Reaching Peaceful Resolution With Quarterbacks Before Resorting To Tackling,Sports News In Brief,2018-10-10T12:58:00-05:00,"NEW YORK—In an effort to find a more constructive way to cost the other team yardage, the NFL asked pass rushers on Wednesday to seek amicable resolutions with opposing quarterbacks before resorting to a tackle. “Instead of immediately stooping to a violent hit, defensive ends and linebackers should take an empathetic stance and try talking the quarterback out of his attempt to throw the ball,” said NFL vice president of human resources Kim McFadden, adding that pass rushers should use “I statements” to keep quarterbacks from feeling threatened while defenders asserted their own feelings as to why the signal caller needs to take a knee and lose a down. “Tackling should always be the last choice when dealing with a quarterback intent on tossing a pass or running for a first down. If players cross the line of scrimmage with an open mind, make eye contact, and calmly present their case, I think they’ll find that most QBs are receptive to spiking the ball or throwing it away.” McFadden admitted that defenders may still be forced to take down their opponent, but should try to depersonalize the attack and limit destructive blows to the quarterback’s torso, neck, ankles, and head."
Report: Students Who Take Latin Have Better Chance Of Summoning Demon Later In Life,News in Brief,2018-10-11T12:01:00-05:00,"CHICAGO—Saying the classical language was a practical choice for anyone interested in awakening the dead, a new report released Thursday by the University of Chicago found that students who take Latin have a better chance of summoning a demon later in life. “According to our data, children who studied Latin in grade school were far more likely to contact, summon, and then raise a damned soul from the underworld,” said classics department chair Emily Greenwood, adding that students who learned Latin tended to be more adept at chanting ancient incantations, opening up portals, and comprehending Demonic screams. “On the whole, young people who studied root languages like Latin had a much easier time communicating in tongues, and could sometimes even convince spirits to do their bidding. However, those who didn’t were more prone to lag far behind their peers and often died at the hands of a bloodthirsty, vengeful succubus.” Greenwood added that while knowing Latin provided students certain advantages in summoning demons, it had absolutely zero bearing on their ability to send them back to Hell when they were done."

For most Americans, seeing politicians completely in control of Congress might be enough to cause them to lose all faith in democracy.” Martin added that preliminary polling also raised the frightening specter of a politician taking the White House in 2020."

No matter how much progress we make, there’s still a strong anti-Italian sentiment in America, and every year, Columbus Day reminds us just how far we still have to go,” said Benedetta Rizzo, current head of the Italian-American Anti-Defamation Society, claiming that the numerous anti-Columbus Day protests around the country demonstrate how Italian-Americans have not yet seen the end of such slurs such as “guido,” “dago,” “guinea,” “wop,” “Tony,” “papist,” “ginso,” “greaser,” or “polenta-eater” and, in many regions, still live in fear of racially motivated attacks. “I remember hearing my parents tell stories of being teased in the school cafeteria for having slices of Italian pizza pie in their lunch boxes.

All we know is that the journalist was covered in blood and missing a lot of limbs when he arrived at the consulate on Tuesday and then left on Thursday—whatever happened to him after that remains a mystery to us.

You don’t even have to know the person; we found that people who regularly channel their inner turmoil into lashing out at waitresses or customer service representatives have lower blood pressure, lead longer lives, and report overall higher levels of happiness.” The therapists also added that should the behavior not produce the desired effect, you are probably not being mean enough to others and should ramp up your attacks."

We believed we’d have at least another century to blow up the Earth, but if the human race is to prevent ecological catastrophe, we need to start yesterday. I, for one, don’t want to have to look my grandchildren in the eyes someday and say I could have blown up the hellish world they’re forced to inhabit but chose not to. That would be the height of selfishness.” Lee then presented a series of terrifying mockups of satellite images depicting what a tragically intact Earth might look like in 2040 and beyond."

Taylor Swift Breaks Political Silence To Throw Support Behind Restoring Shōgun To Throne Of Japan,News in Brief,2018-10-08T12:39:00-05:00,"NEW YORK—In a heartfelt social media statement to her fans, singer–songwriter Taylor Swift broke her long-standing political silence Monday to support restoring an all-powerful shōgun to its rightful place on the throne of Japan. “Hey guys, Taylor here—I’m writing this post because I’ve been inspired by recent events to speak up about why we need to install an all-powerful military dictatorship in Japan’s imperial palace,” said the famously apolitical pop star, admitting that in the past, she had been “reluctant” to voice her long-held support for Japan’s famously brutal system of medieval clan-based governance, but felt differently after witnessing the country’s decay since the final shōgun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, fell from power in 1868. “I believe that a weak-willed democratic Japan is WRONG. I believe the dilution of the proud Tokugawa Clan’s samurai class is WRONG. Please, please educate yourself on the Meiji Restoration’s folly. Only through the blood and steel of a true shōgunate ruler can Japan flourish. Thanks for reading. XOXOXO.” At press time, bloggers had criticized Swift for going too far after she called on current Emperor Akihito to immediately surrender his throne and commit seppuku for disgracing Japan."
Simple Joy Of Childhood Stolen From Toddler Who Was Just Told He Can’t Touch Own Genitals At Dinner Table,,2018-10-09T08:29:00-05:00,"TOLEDO, OH—In a move that obliterated the final vestiges of his youthful innocence, toddler Charles Mankiewicz, 3, was told Tuesday that he could no longer touch his own genitals at the dinner table, robbing him forever of the simple joy of childhood. “Stop that,” said the child’s joyless parents, ensuring that the small boy would never again indulge in the unleavened pleasure of sticking his hand down his own pants without being overwhelmed by all-consuming shame and deep self-loathing. “You can’t just do that, Charlie.” Sources close to the family report the bright smile and sunny disposition that had once defined the 3-year-old, along with the simple bliss of holding his penis, has given way to a bland numbness as the spark of curiosity fades from his dulled eyes."
Report: Most Americans’ Retirement Plans Consist Of Hoping Their Random Junk Turns Out To Be Collector’s Item Worth Millions,News in Brief,2018-10-09T13:45:00-05:00,"WASHINGTON—Shedding new light on how Americans are preparing for their golden years, a report published Tuesday by the National Institute on Retirement Security found that most people’s plans consist entirely of the hope that some random junk piece they own ends up being a collector’s item worth millions of dollars. “Nearly 75 percent of the working-age Americans we surveyed have staked their financial future on the belief that some object lying around their house—whether it’s a collectible ceramic figurine, a DVD of a well-loved film, or a plastic souvenir cup—will turn out to be extremely valuable,” said the report’s author, George Dunbar, noting that a majority of workers have assured themselves there has to be something in their basement worth enough to cover their living expenses in the decades of their life that remain after they have reached retirement age. “Two in three respondents said they have already made plans to take their old Monopoly boards, well-used action figures, and newspapers from an important date in history to be appraised by an expert on the day they retire. While we do not believe this represents a sound retirement plan, we can confirm that in almost every case, the dusty boxes full of miscellaneous shit in Americans’ attics are indeed their highest-value assets.” Dunbar went on to state that clinging to the hope some stray bit of junk would turn out to be worth millions was, of course, a far more viable retirement strategy than the savings programs offered by most employers."

I believe the role I played at the U.N. has provided me with the experiences I need to help him consolidate his power and expand his reign of terror, putting him in a better position to take control of his war-torn homeland.” Haley went on to express her hope that with a little hard work, she could help her new employer become the next Butcher of Kabul."

And now his life has been destroyed by a completely non-credible individual bent on revenge. He has cast a cloud over this esteemed man and he should be deeply ashamed of the damage he has done to his family and the country as a whole.” Grassley added that he was confident the nomination of a morally upright man who had served his country for decades would not be derailed by the ravings of an inveterate liar like Kavanaugh. "
Art Experts Confirm Guggenheim Museum A Forgery,News in Brief,2018-10-05T11:09:00-05:00,"NEW YORK—Suspicious after many patrons noted the hollow thunking noise produced by knocking on the building’s exterior, a group of forensic architects confirmed Friday that the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, long an architectural mainstay of Manhattan’s Upper East side was, in fact, a forgery. “It seems like a legit Lloyd Wright at first, but the colors are a little dull. The original ‘Gug’ has four sections in the cylindrical part instead of only three, and if you go around in back, you can see an entre wing is missing,” said architectural historian Rupert Montgomery, who further noted the cheap plywood construction and the fact that the roof of the knock-off Guggenheim, unlike most of Frank Lloyd Wright’s creations, does not leak. “We compared this current ‘Guggenheim’ with some older photos and realized the switch happened about 2012, which is when modern American impressionist museums began fetching huge sums on the black market. The real Guggenheim is almost certainly in some Saudi’s private collection by now.” Montgomery recommended that cities always keep an eye on their major landmarks, especially during the tourist season."

But information like that could really energize the Republican base, so you can see my dilemma here.” At press time, Feinstein had decided to sit on the evidence until a more politically expedient time."

If not, that’s fine, mind you, seeing as there are so many more important stories in the news these days,” said the celebrated actor, emphasizing that although the recognition is certainly nowhere near as significant as Brett Kavanaugh’s controversial Supreme Court nomination, the Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements, widespread, growing economic inequality and disparity, the tumultuous Trump presidency, and continued accelerating environmental decay, he still believes a show-business career that has resulted in six Golden Globes, six Emmy Awards, three Tony nominations, and an Oscar nomination to be worth at least a little attention. “I mean, sure, it’s not a Nobel Prize, but in its own way, it’s still pretty impressive. Dr. Hawkeye Pierce may not have cured cancer or anything, but my performance on M*A*S*H brought joy to millions of people for over a decade, and I like to think that’s got to count for something. I know, I know, it’s just an award, but they don’t hand it out to just anyone, and I think it’s, you know, just nice to get a little recognition, even for something as trivial as a decades-long entertainment career.” Alda went on to apologize for the role his involvement with M*A*S*H may have contributed to the glorification of the U.S. military-industrial complex."

As soon as we’re done with this press conference, it’s going to be all curing cancer all the time. We urge Americans to remind us of our commitment and really hold our feet to the fire about this to ensure we’re not slacking off. To be on the safe side, we’d recommend that you check back in with us in five years or so to make sure we’re still on track.” Ward added that her team actually had a couple quick things to take care of, but they’d be really putting their noses to the grindstone come next week."
"Paper Towels On Amazon Surge To $2,000 A Roll After Crippling Cost Increase Of Paying Workers A Living Wage",News in Brief,2018-10-02T13:53:00-05:00,"SEATTLE—Hours after the online retailer’s announcement that it would increase the minimum hourly pay rate to $15 for all its U.S. employees, Amazon confirmed Tuesday that paper towels sold on its website had surged to $2,000 per roll due to the crippling cost of paying workers a living wage. “Unfortunately, Amazon’s low payroll expenses were the only thing that kept the price of a three-pack of sponges under $75,000,” said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who acknowledged that while increasing the price of every single product on the company’s site by more than a thousandfold was not ideal, there was simply no other way to pay employees an income necessary to meet basic needs. “Obviously, we’d love to offer competitive compensation that allows Amazon employees to afford food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare without the cost of a dozen fine-point pens skyrocketing from $12.79 to $17,500, but it just isn’t possible. There is no way to sell Transparent for less than $1.5 million per episode without crushing our growth.” The e-commerce giant went on to note that it could no longer afford to offer shipping, and all customers would now be required to pick up their orders in person at an Amazon fulfillment center in Kenosha, WI."

Sources confirmed that Grassley, 85, an Iowa Republican who has served in the Senate since 1981, spent 20 minutes grinning to himself while using a key to etch the message into the paint on the stall door and saying, “That’ll show the lying tramp for dragging Brett through the mud.” Other writing adjacent to Grassley’s message on the Capitol building stall reportedly included “For a good time call Monica Lewinsky,” a crude drawing of a penis ejaculating onto a woman labeled “Hillary Clinton,” as well as a nearly 30-year-old faded message in black Sharpie reading “Anita Hill is a whore” that Grassley recognized as his own handwriting. At press time, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) had led FBI investigators into the bathroom to show them the message, saying it offered conclusive evidence that Dr. Blasey Ford’s accusations were entirely baseless and that she clearly had no integrity whatsoever."

At the time of the exchange, President Trump was very frustrated and exhausted with how utterly pathetic the reporter’s question was, so he unfortunately let slip fewer barbs about her physical appearance and intellectual capabilities than he would have otherwise.” At press time, the record had been corrected once more to deny the existence of any previous version of the transcript."
Nation Urged To Be Extra Sensitive To Men Reliving Trauma Of Not Getting Something,News in Brief,2018-10-01T15:41:00-05:00,"WASHINGTON—Admonishing everyone who knows, works with, or is related to a man to consider the feelings of men for whom the Kavanaugh hearing may have dredged up painful denial-related memories, experts urged the U.S. populace Monday to be extra sensitive to those men who are currently being forced to relive the trauma of wanting a thing but not automatically getting that thing. “It’s certainly not easy to watch Brett Kavanaugh live out this nightmare on the national stage, and our hearts go out to all men who have ever experienced something similar—if you know a man who has ever been denied something or who even feels as if they have been denied something, be sure to make time to check in with them and let them know that you support them,” said specialist Robert Kusinski of the Harvard Center for Masculine Trauma, explaining the importance of excessive empathy in understanding the overarching isolation, shame, and anger felt by adult males who have never even briefly been denied something they wanted upon hearing any version of the word “no.” “Please make sure that you’re mindful of your tone and be kind. Trump-era men have been asked, sometimes even more than once, to relive the traumatic experience of not automatically getting something they desire. The shock of this new experience, on top of not being given something they want, takes an enormous toll on a man. Even the 93 percent of men who eventually do in fact receive the thing they wanted often find themselves experiencing latent feelings of rejection and humiliation, memories of which can return in full force if triggered by high-visibility public events such as poor Mr. Kavanaugh’s ordeal. It’s crucial for non-men to remember that men are grieving right now, and they need you to be there for them.” Kusinski further stressed that, when comforting a man who has experienced this trauma, one should also make sure to apologize sincerely and profusely for any role they may have played in the victim previously not receiving something they wanted."

It seemed like we established a great rapport. I mean, they must have been interested if they brought me back for a second interview, right? Hell, we even delved into some personal stuff from high school, so that’s a good sign,” said Kavanaugh, who had, in a state of panic, reached out to his list of personal references to see if they had been contacted in regards to his candidacy. “Shit, I really want this job. They didn’t mention interviewing anyone else for the position, but maybe they were? I feel like I asked them some pretty decent questions, too. And I mentioned I went to Yale. Fuck, what if I forgot to bring that up?” At press time, Kavanaugh was nervously rewording a follow-up email so that he didn’t come off as too desperate. "

Brett just got his 10-day chip and really needs our encouragement and help, and maybe a place to crash for a bit while he gets back on track.” At press time, Kavanaugh was using his 10-day chip to play quarters."

Staring right into the lens of a camera can hurt vision and self-esteem, plus it’s hard for a developing brain to handle that kind of stimulation.” McCollum concluded the report by suggesting some helpful parental control apps that would allow them to dictate how much time their children can spend editing videos."

Study Finds Humans Evolved Fingers To Stop Dropping Stuff,News in Brief,2018-09-28T09:39:00-05:00,"CHICAGO—In what many have deemed a “missing link” of homosapien development, researchers at Northwestern University announced Friday that humans likely evolved fingers to help them stop dropping stuff. “Based on our analysis, early humans developed digits after centuries of being totally unable to grip things between their two fingerless palms,” said lead researcher Dr. Marci Packer, who confirmed that natural selection effectively weeded out prehistoric humans who frequently attempted to pick up food or tools, but then would either drop them or just end up pushing them along the ground with their smooth, useless hands. “Although some were able to carry essential items between their wrists, in their teeth, or under their chins, fingers changed everything. Before that, humans would often be found dead, buried surrounded by dozens of broken objects.” Packer added that her team of researchers were confident that these findings would help bring them closer to understanding why humans developed toes, whose evolutionary purpose still remains to be seen."

Kavanaugh Claims He Never Committed Sexual Assault As It Will Be Defined After Future Supreme Court Case,News in Brief,2018-09-27T14:12:00-05:00,"WASHINGTON—Speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brett Kavanaugh defended himself against accusations of misconduct Thursday with claims that he never committed sexual assault as it will come to be defined in a future Supreme Court case. “The allegations that I assaulted these women are categorically untrue based on the 2019 case of Sandberg v. Jones, which will establish that only penetrative sex can be classified as assault, and then only in cases with up to four eye-witnesses,” said Kavanaugh, arguing that the upcoming 5-4 decision in which he will write the majority opinion would completely exonerate him. “Admittedly, there are things from my past that cause me to cringe, but I have never done anything that could be considered illegal based on this landmark ruling that will come up in the next few months. Furthermore, these accusations are largely irrelevant as they fall significantly outside the soon-to-be-established statute of limitations of two weeks following an alleged incident.” Kavanaugh added that this whole ordeal had been extremely trying for him and his family, and he looked forward to pursuing legal action against Christine Blasey Ford for violating forthcoming laws against defaming a federal judge."

Cash-Strapped Yellowstone Cuts Funding Of Program To Provide Hibernating Bears With Sleeping Caps,News in Brief,2018-09-26T11:08:00-05:00,"YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WY—In a move that will disappoint campers who delight in seeing the park’s ursine residents in their whimsical matching pajama headgear, nightshirts, and slippers, officials from Yellowstone National Park announced Wednesday that recent budget cuts required eliminating the program that outfits the wilderness area’s hibernating bears with sleeping caps. “Due to unfortunate financial constraints, we will not be able to continue providing our drowsy bears with their iconic pom-pom-topped baby-blue nightcaps for their months-long sleep, nor will we be requisitioning more of those little bunk beds the cubs are tucked into,” said Department of the Interior spokesman Rodney Miller, explaining that the Park Service would also no longer supply finger-ring candle holders for the preserve’s grizzlies, brown bears, and black bears to find their way around with when their caves get dark. “We have managed to allocate a small percentage of the budget in the upcoming fiscal year to give heavy-eyed bears their traditional china teacups and saucers, but these animals will have to begin providing their own sleepy-time teas.” Miller, however, noted that the park was able to retain funding for the spectacles worn by Yellowstone’s owls."
Researchers Observe Chimpanzees Using Pro Tools,News in Brief,2018-09-27T15:25:00-05:00,"TUSCALOOSA, AL—In a groundbreaking experiment that shows humans aren’t the only species capable of operating industry-standard recording software, researchers at the University of Alabama confirmed Thursday they had observed chimpanzees using Pro Tools. “Within minutes of being placed near a full suite of audio equipment, the chimps in our study had not only mastered the basic record and playback functions, but had also discovered how to add crude layers of synth, bass, and drums to establish a sick groove,” said lead researcher Anthony Cho, who noted that chimpanzees were found to possess the cognitive and motor skills necessary to EQ, compress, and auto-tune tracks containing the primitive vocalizations they use to communicate. “Other nonhuman primates, including gorillas and orangutans, have been seen operating simple analog tape recorders, but none have come close to creating professional-sounding, dance-friendly pop singles. It appears that all chimps need is a microphone, a studio, and a few hours alone, and they can create a track that fucking slaps.” The researchers went on to suggest that the only characteristics separating humans from lesser apes now appear to be the human abilities to generate buzz on social media and license music for television commercials.

Kavanaugh Impressed By Hazing Rituals Before They Let You Join Supreme Court,News in Brief,2018-09-27T14:40:00-05:00,"WASHINGTON—Admitting he was surprised by all the tasks required of him in order to enter the prestigious organization, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh reportedly stated Thursday that he was impressed by the hazing rituals you have to go through before they let you join the Supreme Court. “Man, I knew the Supreme Court doesn’t let just anyone in, but I’ve got to say, they’ve really made me run the gauntlet and do all this embarrassing stuff—I mean, I had to go on national television with my wife and tell everyone how long I was a virgin,” said Kavanaugh, acknowledging that he had to respect the humiliating challenges he’s been put through to prove himself worthy of the Supreme Court, like showing his high school diary to the entire country and having to face multiple women from his youth who he “didn’t even go all the way with.” “I did some pretty gnarly stuff back during my fraternity days, so I figured they’d force me to get paddled or chant the Supreme Court motto ‘Equal Justice Under Law’ for a few hours outside in my underwear or stick my thumb up someone’s ass, but this hazing is really putting me through a wringer. But I’ll do whatever I have to if it means they’ll let me be a justice. Supreme Court for life!” Kavanaugh added that when he had felt especially ashamed during the hazing process, he just reminded himself that this was the same initiation his future Supreme Court brother Clarence Thomas had to endure."

I’d be fine if he were just going around talking about how much he values women who are beautiful, but he shouldn’t be saying all this other stuff. What if it affects the way he rules? I should probably just withdraw the nomination before people start questioning my judgment.” At press time, sources reported President Trump had placed a frantic phone call to U.S. circuit judge Amy Barrett, saying her views on women could definitely be trusted."

I know, I know, sometimes Tyler thought I was being too hard on him growing up, but someday, maybe the morning after an office party or giving the babysitter a ride home, he’ll look back and appreciate that I raised him to get away with doing absolutely anything he wants.” Fitzgerald also expressed pride that her son sought out the friendship and company of other men who had been raised to treat women with respect in any situation where there are witnesses."

We love them deeply and completely. We love stacking logs, chopping logs, sawing logs, carrying logs, trimming logs, debarking logs, processing logs, drying logs, throwing logs in the back of a trailer, ratcheting down logs, driving logs to a lumberyard, turning logs into planks, building a house with logs—hell, sometimes we like to just stand there for hours and stare at a log, smiling ear to ear the whole time,” said Bill Wright, CEO of Zuelke Logging Service, echoing the sentiments of the 67,000 other members of the logging industry in confirming that logs kicked fucking ass. “We go totally apeshit for logs. A list of our interests starts and ends with the word ‘logs.’ We wake up each morning champing at the bit to chop more logs, and every second we’re not spending in a lumberyard, a forest, or the woods is a second wasted. We love how logs smell, we love how they feel, we love their shape, and we just can’t contain ourselves when we’re moving a log around with a logging crane. Logs in the morning, logs at night, and in between? Logs. Turn them into paper, turn them into timber, log our logs in the log log and then log into our logging blog. Big logs, small logs, average logs—we love them all. Even as I speak at this very moment, I’m thinking about logs and praying to God this press conference—which is at least about logs—wraps up soon so I can go back to my logs and be happy. Logs. Ah, logs. Fuck! Logs, man, no shit, I fucking tell you. Logs.” The logging industry solemnly added that Wright was crushed to death later that afternoon by a log, as per his dying wish."

Or the sperm-shaped alien fetus in it’s glowing, rosey tones? Of course. Which is why today, Eraserhead, and my 1980 film The Elephant Man, will be filled in with over 4,000 shades of beautiful color.” Lynch also added that the new release would be re-cut to include a pivotal scene in which a doctor operates on Henry’s baby early on, allowing it to lead a normal life."

This is the worst spill since the offshore water drilling rig rupture in 1998—shame on Dasani for such a clear disregard for this delicate ecosystem.” At press time, Devantez predicted that the water would continue washing up on shore for months to come."
